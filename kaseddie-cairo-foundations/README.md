Kaseddie Cairo Foundations
This repository documents my journey of rebuilding the on-chain components for Kaseddie AI from the ground up.

The Goal
Inspired by direct feedback from the Starknet Foundation, the purpose of this repository is to build a strong, foundational understanding of Cairo and Starknet development. The focus here is not on speed or complexity, but on correctness, security, and best practices.

Each contract will be simple, well-tested, and built with a deep understanding of its function.

The Journey
I am building this in public to share my learnings and contribute to the Starknet ecosystem. This repository will serve as the foundation for the next, production-ready version of the Kaseddie AI platform.

Thank you for following along.
